## Hi there 👋

I’m Javi — an engineer and professor with a multidisciplinary profile bridging **engineering**, **law** and **technology** ⚙️⚖️📡. 

I connect disciplines to turn messy, real-world constraints into clear decisions, robust processes, and systems people can actually rely on.

My brain runs on chaos and entropy 🌪️🧠.
